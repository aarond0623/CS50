sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Although, like sort3, sort1 is much slower than sort2, it
performs much faster when the data is already sorted. Unlike selection sort,
bubble sort can "break out" of its algorithm if the data is already sorted,
and can complete in O(n) instead of O(n^2).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 is orders of magnitude faster than either of the other
two sorting programs, even on the 50,000 element lists.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: sort3 runs slowly regardless of whether the list is sorted
(the best case) or in reverse order (the worst case). Selection sort must make
all the same comparisons it does in its worst case, unlike bubble sort.
